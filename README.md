# Stock Search Application (Github Pages Link: https://github.com/downtownadambrown/Stock-Search-Application)

For this project, I was tasked with creating a stock search web application for my client.  This application uses the iexTrading API to make a dynamic web page that populates with cryptocurrency information of the user's choice. 

To finish this task, it will call the API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

# Tools / Libraries used
* HTML5
* CSS3, Bootstrap, SASS
* ES6 vanilla Javascript
* jQuery primarily for AJAX handling
* RESTful web service (NY Times public API)
* BootPopUp.js - https://github.com/rigon/bootpopup
