# Stock Search Application

For this project, I was tasked with creating a fully-fleshed-out cryptocurrency web application for my client.  This application will use the iexTrading API to make a dynamic web page that populates with crypto currency information of the user's choice. 

To finish this task, it will call the cryptoCurrency API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

# Tools / Libraries used
* HTML5
* CSS3 / SASS
* ES6 vanilla Javascript
* jQuery primarily for AJAX handling
* RESTful web service (NY Times public API)
